**Quarto**

Quarto is a two-player board game implemented in Java, featuring two gameplay modes: Person vs Person and Person vs Computer. The game is available via both Console and Graphical User Interface (GUI), using Java's Swing for the GUI. The game leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and data structures to simulate and automate gameplay. This project demonstrates the application of OOP’s four pillars—Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction—along with the use of key data structures.


**Features**


Gameplay Modes:

  Person vs Person: Two players can play on the same machine, taking turns to place pieces on the 4x4 board.
  
  Person vs Computer: One player competes against an AI opponent that uses a basic strategy (both easy and medium of computer player are available).
  
Board Game: The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where players take turns placing pieces on the board.

Figures: The game includes 16 distinct figures, each characterized by four attributes: Color, Height, Shape, and Form.

Jokers: Special figures that add a dynamic element to the game by offering additional powers for each attribute of the figure (for example, ColorJoker matches with any color near itself).

Object-Oriented Programming: The game uses OOP principles to organize code into manageable, reusable classes.


**Technologies Used**


Java: The entire game is written in Java, making use of its Object-Oriented capabilities.

Computer Player: A simple AI system that chooses moves based on basic heuristics and randomization to simulate challenging gameplay.

Jokers: Special pieces that provide additional strategic moves.

GUI: Java Swing is used to implement the graphical user interface for a better user experience.
